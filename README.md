Research Methodology Project on Evaluating Rice grains quality using image processing techniques

**Image-Processing-approach-towards-Rice-Quality-Analysis**
Using image processing techniques, this research provides a system for grading and evaluating rice grains based on grain size and form. The edge detection technique, in particular, is utilised to determine the region of each grain's borders. Using this approach, I discovered the endpoints of each grain, and then we can measure the length and width of rice with a calliper. This approach takes the least amount of time and costs the least amount of money.

**Evaluating Rice grains quality using image processing techniques:**
Method 1 : I analyse the quality of rice by calculating the average length/breadth ratio for each rice grain. I am using Image processing Based on this ratio, rice quality can be graded. I am using openCV, numpy, and matplotlib libraries in Python 2.

Method 2: I analyse the quality of rice by calculating the Centrod, major Axis and Minor Axis to find out average Height and width of rice quality. For this i used MATLAB

**Running Locally**
**METHOD 1**
clone this repo
- install the necessary libraries
- run `Rice_Quality_analysis.ipynb
See the output in the Output Folder
**METHOD 2**
open MATLAB online
Upload rice image
upload rice measurement.m code
execute the code
Observe results on the console

Please note: Kindly update all the file paths whever required
For both the methods use image rice.jpg and G2_3.jpg
